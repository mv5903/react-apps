# Welcome to my very first react project!

I'll be building two apps using [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dorf8i6lCuk).

Each commit will represent each part of the video, and you'll be able to track my progress along the way.

Eventually I plan on making my own website with React, will all code fully available soon.

You can view my current website at [mattvandenberg.com](https://www.mattvandenberg.com).
